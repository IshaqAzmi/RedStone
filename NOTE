Hi,

Since Eliajah left I have not had much time to work on Auto/Xelhua. I 
plan to fix that starting today. You will notice Xelhua's website will 
be back up really soon and Auto development will slowly recover. I, 
however, cannot do this alone. If you would like to help please shoot me 
an email at mattwb65@gmail.com, please include "Ethrik Development" in 
the subject. 

If you have any other questions or would just like to watch development 
I plan to restart the irc channel. That can be found at 
irc.ethrik.net #xelhua. 

Thanks,
Matthew


UPDATE: Site, forums, wiki, and release files up.
UPDATE: Down again, moving servers, more to come.
UPDATE: Xelhua is dead, Ethrik will be replacement.
