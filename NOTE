Hi,

The original Auto repository is now back online. If you are looking for
the original legacy version of Auto, please visit
https://github.com/Auto/Auto-legacy and download from there. From my
understanding developing of the legacy versions is very limited and
more work is being put into the next generation of Auto.

If you have any other questions or would just like to watch development 
of Auto, you should join the irc channel. That can be found at 
irc.freenode.net #auto. 

Thanks,
Russell
