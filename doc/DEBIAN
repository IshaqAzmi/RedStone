It has come to my concern that users are encountering problems
when running Auto on Debian. Specifically, the install script
will error out. The reason for this is because Debian includes
a version of File::Path that is old. The fix to this is to
install the latest version via cpan. You can do this via:
cpan -i File::Path

Effected:
   Debian
   Ubuntu
