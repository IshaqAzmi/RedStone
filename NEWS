          3.0

The future of IRC bots is here! Xelhua gives to you, Auto 3.0, a new version of
the popular Auto IRC bot.

In this alpha12 release, we have added:

* IPLookup: Lookup information on an IP address
* contact_home: Collect stats on version/operating systems Auto is ran on. In the future this will be expanded upon.
* API: allow hooking to any and every possible command via rchook.
* Pisg: Added a module to automate Pisg and log with a recognized format.
* API::Socket - Exposing sockets to the API allowing custom sockets/parsers in modules.
* BotStats: Changed command to match module name and added support for API::Socket.

Bug fixes:

* var/ permissions error on first run.

Incompatibilities:

None

We thank you for choosing Auto. Please remember that he is coming to late
development stages soon, and testers are needed! But we hope we've piqued
your interest, as Auto's upcoming module repository will allow modules to be
created by anyone and uploaded there for everyone to use.

Auto's goal is to create an efficient, stable and highly customizable IRC bot
in Perl. To offer an alternative to other platforms.

Enjoy Auto 3.0.0 Alpha 12!
